// src/libs/thread_pool.rs

//! A simple, robust threadâ€‘pool for executing `FnOnce() + Send + 'static` jobs.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use my_project::ThreadPool;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let pool = ThreadPool::new(4);
//!     for i in 0..8 {
//!         pool.execute(move || {
//!             println!("Hello from task {}", i);
//!         });
//!     }
//!     // When `pool` goes out of scope, it will gracefully shut down.
//! }
//! ```
